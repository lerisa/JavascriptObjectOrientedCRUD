//We initialize the application by defining its namespace and MVC subnamespaces
var pl = {
    model: {},
    view: {},
    ctrl: {}
};


//First, we define a root namespace (object) for our app, 
//and then we define three subnamespaces, 
//one for each of the three parts of the application
// code: model, view and controller.
